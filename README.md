# DartPractice_Exercises_1-5

#Exercise 1
Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. Print out a message that tells how many years they have to be 100 years old.

#Exercise 2
Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user.

#Exercise 3
Take a list, say for example this one:

  a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
  
and write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are less than 5.

#Exercise 4
Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number.

If you donâ€™t know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into another number. For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.

#Exercise 5

Take two lists, for example:

  a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]

  b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
and write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between them (without duplicates). Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes.
